# Currently in development !

This project aim to create a multiplatform Gcode interpreter based on a STM32F411VIT6.
The goal is to create a software and hardware capable of controlling a 2 axis machine
based on the CoreXY mechanic.

Since Mechanic is not my forte, the platform will be based on a AxiDraw for simplicity.
